## Exercises: Functions

Try to start from scratch!

### The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

### The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

### The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

### The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

```http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm```

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

### The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

```http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html```

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."


## Calculator!!!  

The Calculator

Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."

Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:

Take half of the number and store the result.
Square the result of #1 and store that result.
Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).

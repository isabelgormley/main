# JS Do Now

## Setup

Make a folder called `js_basics` inside your do_now folder. Inside `js_basics` touch an index.html and an app.js and link them together. Write all of your javascript answers in `app.js`, and test them in the Chrome console.


## Conceptual Questions

#### Give an example in JavaScript along with your answers

1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
2. How do we change the value of a variable? 
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

## Exercises

1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
  - assign it the value of the string `"Hello World"`
  - change the value of this variable to a number.
  - store the value of `firstVariable` into a new variable called `secondVariable` 
  - change the value of `secondVariable` to a string. 
  - What is the value of `firstVariable`?

2. Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string.
  - Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it returns a new string with them concatenated. 
  *(ex: "Hello, my name is Jean Valjean")*

# Javascript Primitives 

## Conceptual Questions

1. Name 4 different built in primitives in Javascript.
2. What is the difference between an integer and a float (maybe you'll want to look up what float is)?

# Javascript - Boolean operators

#### 1.
Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operator that evaluates the expression to true. :wave:

Remember:

<ul>
  <li>==</li>
  <li>===</li>
  <li>!=</li>
  <li>!==</li>
  <li>></li>
  <li><</li>
  <li>>=</li>
  <li><=</li>
</ul>

```
  var a = 4;
  var b = 53;
  var c = 57;
  var d = 16;
  var e = 'Andrew';
```

-  a _ b;
-  c _ d;
-  'Name' ___ 'Name';
-  a _ b ___ c;
-  a _ a ___ d;
-  e ___ 'Andrew';
-  48 ___ '48';


#### 2. Using the Or `||`, And `&&`, and Not `!`

```
   var bump = true;
   var grind = true;
```

Using the variables `bump` and `grind` write three different expressions that are `True` and three different expressions that evaluate to `False`.
